The objective of this website is to appeal to potential employers, clients, and partners as a suitible web developer. 

The heading gives the viewer a brief introduction, with my full name, followed by a picture of myself directly underneath. This gives the viewer a face to the name, making the website/portfolio more personable.

Below the picture, is where the viewer will find a link to view my work samples on GitHub, in the "Work Samples" section.

If the viewer wants to futher engage, they are given the oppotunity to do so with the listed email address and phone number underneath the "Work Samples" section. This section is listed as "Contact Information"

At the end, in the footer, the view will be able to see my main goal for web development.
